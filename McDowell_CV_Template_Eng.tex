		\begin{cvsubsection}{inDrive, Trust \& Safety, Product Analyst}{\textit{September 2024 -- Present}}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Created the Graph system of related accounts with aggressors, which enabled the development of automatic bans and reduced the number of repeat incidents by approximately \textbf{\textasciitilde ~15\%} in Latin America;
				\item Trained a passenger safety scoring model based on 50 parameters and achieved \textbf{30\%} Precision on an imbalanced dataset. This helped launch the process of creating a feature store for implementing complex models in production;
				\item Launched an in-trip monitoring model utilizing 5 key features to detect ride deviations. This system triggered push notifications with a user feedback form, which led to a \textbf{3k} monthly increase in new incident reports \textbf{(\textasciitilde ~5\%)} and enabled us to discover them earlier;
				\item Launched 15 experiments and developed a library for A/B testing using Python, which reduced the time for compiling results by approximately \textbf{\textasciitilde 25\%} (\href{https://github.com/Renarion/expab}{GitHub}).
			\end{itemize}
		\end{cvsubsection}
		
		\begin{cvsubsection}{InvestEngine, Product Analyst}{\textit{March 2024 -- August 2024}}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Implemented the system of user events and launched the integration with Google BigQuery;
				\item Created the analytics documentation and developed a framework with over 10 product metrics that became the basis for the operational team's KPIs.
			\end{itemize}
		\end{cvsubsection}
		
		\begin{cvsubsection}{Tinkoff (T-Bank), SME, Product Analyst}{\textit{March 2023 -- March 2024}}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Conducted a study and launched an experiment to implement a new process for handling applications for establishing individual entrepreneurship, which helped increase the utilization CR by approximately \textbf{\textasciitilde 11\%} and generated over \textbf{\$10k} in revenue;
				\item Identified the cause of increased churn rate for debit (business) cards and assisted in developing marketing campaigns that reduced this metric by approximately \textbf{\textasciitilde 3\%};
			\end{itemize}
		\end{cvsubsection}
		
		\begin{cvsubsection}{Ozon, Express delivery, Data Analyst}{\textit{August 2021 -- March 2023}}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Based on data from the advertising dashboard, created a report on bids and key queries; this helped effectively optimize advertising and increase ROMI by approximately \textbf{\textasciitilde 10\%};
				\item Implemented an investment return forecast based on historical data within a category segmented by paid and organic traffic, taking into account all possible sales placements; this helped attract over \textbf{\$25k} in investments.
			\end{itemize}
